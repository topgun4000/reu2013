\textbf{Problem:}\\
Determine a general form for the maximum sum of the degrees of $k+1$ vertices in 
one partition of a bipartite graph. The purpose is to prove an easy method for 
weeding out invalid degree sequences for the Zarankiewicz number checker script.

\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.5]
  \draw (0,0) ellipse (1cm and 2cm);
  \draw (8,0) ellipse (1.5cm and 3cm);
  \node at (0,0) (N) {$N$};
  \node at (8,0) (M) {$M$};
\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}

$$|N|=n,\ |M|=m,\ n\le m $$
Denote the degree sequence $S$ of $N$ as $s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_{n-1}$.

\textbf{Lemma:}
$$\sum_{i=0}^ks_i \le m + \binom{k+1}{2}$$
In addition, equality is theoretically achievable if $m \ge \binom{k+1}{2}$.

\textbf{Proof:}\\
Generalize Theorem 2 given in Guy. Alternatively:\\

Let $\Delta_k$ denote $\sum_{i=0}^ks_i$.\\
Suppose $$\Delta_k = m + \binom{k+1}{2} + 1.$$
Partition the set $M$ into $k+1$ subsets.\\
We must add $\binom{k+1}{2} + 1$ edges to the $k+1$ vertices in $N$ in order for
the sum of the degree sequences to reach $m + \binom{k+1}{2} + 1$.\\
We can have a maximum of $\binom{k+1}{2}$ intersections of two of the $k+1$ subsets.\\
By the pigeon-hole principle, at least one such intersection must contain at least two
vertices.\\
But this would constitute a $C_4$. Contradiction.\\

A simple construction based on this proof shows that $\Delta_k=m+\binom{k+1}{2}$ is
theoretically achievable if $m\ge \binom{k+1}{2}$.\\

\textbf{Solution:}\\
Thus we can eliminate all degree sequences in which the sum of the largest $k$ degrees
exceeds $m + \binom{k}2$.
